One of my favorite things about macOS is the ease of creating hotkey-bound Automator services to do various system-level activities like turning off my displays.  This one aims to replicate the functionality of the Windows program "SoundSwitch" in [switchaudio-osx](https://github.com/deweller/switchaudio-osx).

The Automator service should look like this:

Which you can then bind to a system-wide keyboard shortcut using `System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services`.
